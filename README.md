Yo, I'm [Your Name] 👋

A Little Bit About Me...

    🌱 Just a human trying to teach computers how to think.

    🔭 Currently lost in a jungle of <div>s and <span>s.

    🤔 Thinking about how to build a coffee machine that codes for me.

    💬 Ask me about anything, I'll probably have a wildly speculative answer.

    📫 How to reach me: Send a raven or use the links below.

    😄 Pronouns: he/him/she/her/they/them/your_highness

    ⚡ Fun fact: I can talk to cats. They don't listen, but I try.

🚀 What I'm Dabbling With

    Project Neon - An app that translates your dreams into abstract art. (It's mostly just colorful squiggles right now).

    The Ultimate Todo List - It has confetti, sound effects, and probably too many animations.

    Secret Lair Schematics - A website to design your own evil genius hideout.
